            <h1 id="Singapore-Casinos-Win-at-Baccarat"><a href="#Singapore-Casinos-Win-at-Baccarat" class="headerlink" title="Singapore Casinos Win at Baccarat"></a>Singapore Casinos Win at Baccarat</h1><p>In the high-stakes world of Singapore casino gambling, baccarat is king. Operators of the city-state’s two licensed casinos raked in S$2.3 billion ($1.7 billion) in gross gaming revenue last year from the game, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>That’s more than 60 percent of all casino gambling revenue in Singapore and about twice as much as what operators earned from slots, Singapore’s dominant casino game.</p>
<p>Baccarat is a simple card game that originated in Italy in the 15th century. The goal is to draw cards with a point total as close as possible to nine. Winning bets are paid at even money, while losing bets are taken by the house.<br>The attraction for many Asian bettors is that they can use superstitious practices, such as wearing lucky clothes or sitting in specific seats, to give themselves an edge over the house.</p>
<p>Casino executives say baccarat’s popularity owes less to any special appeal it has for Asians and more to its relatively low house edge – just 1 percent – which gives gamblers a better chance of winning than games like slots or roulette.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Tax-Revenue-on-the-Rise-in-Singapore"><a href="#Casino-Tax-Revenue-on-the-Rise-in-Singapore" class="headerlink" title="Casino Tax Revenue on the Rise in Singapore"></a>Casino Tax Revenue on the Rise in Singapore</h1><p>Casino tax revenue in Singapore has been on the rise in recent years, hitting a new high of S$679 million in FY2017. This is due in part to the increase in visitors to the country’s two casinos, Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa.</p>
<p>The increase in casino tax revenue is also attributable to the government’s efforts to promote responsible gambling. For example, it has introduced measures such as reducing the number of gaming tables and banning locals from entering the casinos.</p>
<p>As a result of the higher casino tax revenue, the government is able to channel more funds into areas such as education and health care. In particular, it was able to allocate an additional S$2 billion for healthcare expenditure in FY2017. This will help to improve Singapore’s already impressive healthcare system.</p>
<h1 id="Singaporean-Casinos-see-profits-in-Baccarat"><a href="#Singaporean-Casinos-see-profits-in-Baccarat" class="headerlink" title="Singaporean Casinos see profits in Baccarat"></a>Singaporean Casinos see profits in Baccarat</h1><p>Singaporean casinos are reaping the financial benefits of Baccarat with the game now accounting for a majority of casino gross gaming revenue (GGR) in the country.</p>
<p>Baccarat has overtaken roulette as the most popular casino game in Singapore, with GGR from the game rising by over 50% in 2018 to reach SGD$2.5 billion. The rise in popularity of baccarat is attributed to its relatively simple rules and favourable odds for players.</p>
<p>Casinos have responded to the increased demand for baccarat by introducing more tables and increasing the betting limits. In fact, at some casinos, such as Marina Bay Sands, baccarat accounts for up to 90% of GGR.</p>
<p>The strong performance of Singaporean casinos is in contrast to those in other major Asian gambling markets such as Macau and Hong Kong. In Macau, GGR from baccarat has been declining since 2017 as a result of government crackdowns on corruption. In Hong Kong, GGR from all casino games fell by 5% in 2018, largely due to a decline in revenue from VIP gamblers.</p>
<p>The healthy performance of Singaporean casinos is likely to continue in 2019, with new Integrated Resorts (IRs) set to open later this year. These IRs, which include resorts such as Jewel Changi Airport and Resorts World Sentosa, will offer even more premium baccarat experiences for players.</p>
<h1 id="Big-Wins-for-Casino-Operators-in-Singapore"><a href="#Big-Wins-for-Casino-Operators-in-Singapore" class="headerlink" title="Big Wins for Casino Operators in Singapore"></a>Big Wins for Casino Operators in Singapore</h1><p>Singapore is one of the most lucrative casino markets in Asia, and casino operators have been reaping the benefits over the past few years. The country’s two integrated resorts – Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) – generated a combined SGD7.5 billion (US$5.3 billion) in gross gaming revenue (GGR) in 2018, up 6.8% from SGD7.1 billion in 2017.</p>
<p>Casino operator profits have surged as a result, with MBS reporting a net profit of SGD2.9 billion for 2018, up 18% from SGD2.5 billion in 2017, while RWS saw its net profit more than double to SGD1.1 billion last year from SGD500 million in 2017.</p>
<p>The strong performance of Singapore’s casinos has been driven by an increase in visitor arrivals and spending over the past few years, thanks to the country’s strong economy and stable political environment. In 2018, visitor arrivals at MBS and RWS exceeded 30 million for the first time, up 7% from 28 million in 2017. These visitors spent an average of SGD1,280 per trip last year, up from SGD1,190 in 2017.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Singapore’s casino market is expected to continue performing well over the next few years as growth in key markets such as China and India support continued visitor arrivals and spending growth. In particular, MBS is expected to benefit from increased visitation from Chinese tourists following the opening of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong express rail link later this year. This will provide much shorter travel times between the Chinese cities and Singapore, making it easier for travellers to visit MBS.</p>
<h1 id="Baccarat-a-Big-Winner-for-Casino-Operators-in-Singapore"><a href="#Baccarat-a-Big-Winner-for-Casino-Operators-in-Singapore" class="headerlink" title="Baccarat a Big Winner for Casino Operators in Singapore"></a>Baccarat a Big Winner for Casino Operators in Singapore</h1><p>Slot machines may be the bread and butter of casino operators in Singapore, but it is baccarat that is generating the big profits.</p>
<p>Data from the Casino Control Authority shows that gross gaming revenue (GGR) from baccarat totaled S$2.26 billion in 2017, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total GGR of S$3.37 billion. This was significantly higher than the GGR of S$1.06 billion generated by slot machines.</p>
<p>Most of the baccarat action is taking place at the casinos operated by Resorts World Genting and Marina Bay Sands. Genting generated S$1.65 billion in GGR from baccarat last year, while Marina Bay Sands registered GGR of S$609 million.</p>
<p>The popularity of baccarat can be attributed to its relatively low house edge – just 1.06 percent – as well as the propensity of Singaporeans to indulge in high-stakes gambling.</p>
<p>“Baccarat has always been popular among Singaporeans due to its lower house edge and the opportunity to bet large sums of money,” said Chris Jones, an analyst at Union Gaming Group LLC.</p>
<p>With such healthy profits being generated from baccarat, it is no wonder that casino operators are putting a lot of focus on this game segment. For example, Genting has been investing in new baccarat tables and systems to lure more players to its casinos in Singapore.</p>
