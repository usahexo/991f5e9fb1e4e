This is great news for fans of sports betting, as they can now place bets on their favorite teams without having to worry about breaking the law.</p>
<p>The court’s decision comes after several years of debate on the issue. Supporters of sports betting argue that it is a harmless way to enjoy sporting events, while opponents claim that it can lead to addiction and crime. In the end, however, the court sided with the supporters, ruling that sports betting is not a threat to public safety and can be enjoyed in a responsible manner.</p>
<p>This ruling is likely to have a major impact on the gambling industry in Arizona. The state is home to several large casinos, and it is likely that many of them will begin offering sports betting once the decision goes into effect. This should provide a major boost to the state’s economy, as well as create new jobs in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Sports fans in Arizona are sure to rejoice at this news. They can now place bets on their favorite teams without fear of being arrested or facing other legal penalties. This will add an extra layer of excitement to sporting events, making them even more enjoyable to watch.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-betting-begins-today-in-Arizona"><a href="#Sports-betting-begins-today-in-Arizona" class="headerlink" title="Sports betting begins today in Arizona!"></a>Sports betting begins today in Arizona!</h1><p>The Diamondbacks and Rockies open up their series today in Phoenix, with the first pitch scheduled for 12:40 p.m. MST.<br>Both teams are coming off of losses on Friday night, so there is certainly an incentive to win this early game on Saturday.<br>Colorado is currently a -123 favorite to win the game, while Arizona is at +113.<br>This line seems about right, as the Rockies have been playing better baseball as of late while the Diamondbacks continue to struggle.</p>
<p>There are a few key matchups that could have an impact on the game. For Colorado, left fielder Gerardo Parra will likely be matched up against Diamondbacks pitcher Patrick Corbin. Parra has been red-hot as of late and is batting .405 this season. If Corbin can’t get Parra out, it could be a long day for the D-Backs.<br>Colorado’s bullpen will also need to be strong in this matchup, as Arizona has some dangerous hitters coming up late in the order.</p>
<p>For Arizona, Paul Goldschmidt will be a player to watch. He has been one of the few bright spots for the team this year and is batting .317 with 16 home runs already. If he can continue his hot streak, it could help Arizona pull off an upset victory.<br>Overall, I expect Colorado to win this game but it should be close. Take the Rockies -123 over the Diamondbacks +113 for your Saturday afternoon betting action!</p>

<p>Those who are new to sports betting may not be entirely sure how it works. Basically, you are placing a bet on the outcome of a sporting event. You can choose to bet on the winning team or on the total score of the game. There are also many different types of bets that you can place. If you are unsure about which type of bet to make, you can always consult with a professional gambler.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind when betting on sports is that it is important to do your research. Just like in any other type of gambling, you want to make informed decisions. This means checking out statistics and odds for each team involved in the game. It also helps to know about the players and coaches involved.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider when betting on sports is your budget. It is important to set limits for yourself and to stick to them. If you lose too much money, you could end up losing more than just your bets – you could also lose your house or car!</p>
<p>Now that sports betting is legal in Arizona, there are sure to be plenty of people who will take advantage of it. So if you’re looking for something fun and exciting to do while in the state, make sure to give sports betting a try!</p>
