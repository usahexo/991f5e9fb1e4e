<p>The Goo Goo Dolls are an American rock band formed in 1986 in Buffalo, New York. The band consists of two members: John Rzeznik (lead vocals, guitar) and Robby Takac (bass, vocals). They have sold more than 12 million albums and won four Grammy Awards. Some of their most popular songs include “Iris” and “Name.”</p>
