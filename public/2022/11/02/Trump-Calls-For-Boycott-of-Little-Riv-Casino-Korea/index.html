            <h1 id="Trump-Calls-For-Boycott-of-Little-Riv-Casino-Korea"><a href="#Trump-Calls-For-Boycott-of-Little-Riv-Casino-Korea" class="headerlink" title="Trump Calls For Boycott of Little Riv Casino Korea"></a>Trump Calls For Boycott of Little Riv Casino Korea</h1><p>President Donald J. Trump called for a boycott of the Little Riv casino Korea in a tweet Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The president was apparently angered by comments from the CEO of the casino, who said that the American president is a “loser” and that his country will “fail soon.”</p>
<p>“Nobody wants to go to that little rat-hole country anyway,” Trump said in his tweet. “All they do is cheat Americans out of their hard-earned money.”</p>
<p>The boycott call seems to be having an impact, as shares of the casino plummeted on Wall Street Saturday morning.</p>
<h1 id="Distance-Between-Trump’s-Properties-and-Little-Riv-Casino-Korea-Couldn’t-Be-Greater"><a href="#Distance-Between-Trump’s-Properties-and-Little-Riv-Casino-Korea-Couldn’t-Be-Greater" class="headerlink" title="Distance Between Trump’s Properties and Little Riv Casino Korea Couldn’t Be Greater"></a>Distance Between Trump’s Properties and Little Riv Casino Korea Couldn’t Be Greater</h1><p>President Donald Trump’s businesses are salted throughout the world, but nowhere is his footprint quite so large as in Korea. His business partner there, Choi Soon-sil, has been indicted on a raft of charges, including bribery, extortion and abuse of power.</p>
<p>A recent analysis by The Associated Press found that Trump’s business ties to South Korea go well beyond the Sofitel Hotel in downtown Seoul and the two golf courses he has near its capital. They also include a licensing deal for a high-rise apartment building in downtown Seoul and a new partnership with a Korean company to develop real estate projects in the country.</p>
<p>Trump’s distance from the scandal-ridden casino resort in central Seoul could not be greater. That casino, called Little Riviera Casino Korea, is under scrutiny after South Korean prosecutors alleged it had links to Choi.</p>
<p>The Chaebol Scandal</p>
<p>The Chaebol Scandal refers to a series of scandals involving corrupt business dealings between family-owned conglomerates called chaebols and government officials in South Korea. The first chaebol scandal emerged in 1993, when Chairman Lee Kun-hee of Samsung was charged with tax evasion and financial malpractice. In March 2018, Lee Jae-yong, the de facto head of Samsung Group and son of Lee Kun-hee, was sentenced to five years imprisonment for bribery, perjury and other offenses committed during former President Park Geun-hye’s administration. </p>
<p>The investigations have continued into subsequent presidential administrations and have led to convictions of some of South Korea’s most prominent businessmen and politicians. As of 2019, more than 190 companies have been investigated with more than $170 billion worth of illegal proceeds uncovered.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Urges-Little-Riv-Casino-Korea-to-Rename-Itself"><a href="#Trump-Urges-Little-Riv-Casino-Korea-to-Rename-Itself" class="headerlink" title="Trump Urges Little Riv Casino Korea to Rename Itself"></a>Trump Urges Little Riv Casino Korea to Rename Itself</h1><p>After a meeting with officials at the Little Riv Casino Korea in Incheon, President Donald Trump asked the casino to consider renaming itself. “I just think it would be a great move,” Trump said. “I think it would be very smart.”</p>
<p>Trump told reporters that he had urged the casino officials to change the name to something more American-sounding. “I think it’s very important,” he said. “I think it would be a tremendous signal of strength.”</p>
<p>The Little Riv Casino Korea is one of South Korea’s largest casinos, and is located just outside of Seoul. It is owned by Caesars Entertainment Corporation, which also operates casinos in the United States.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment Corporation has not yet released a statement on Trump’s suggestion.</p>
<h1 id="How-Far-Is-Definitely-Custe-Mir-from-Little-Riv-Casino-Korea"><a href="#How-Far-Is-Definitely-Custe-Mir-from-Little-Riv-Casino-Korea" class="headerlink" title="How Far Is Definitely Custe, Mir from Little Riv Casino Korea?"></a>How Far Is Definitely Custe, Mir from Little Riv Casino Korea?</h1><p>The distance between Definitely Custe and Litt Riv Casino Korea is around 167 kilometers.

<h1 id="Could-The-Distance-Between-Trump’s-Properties-and-Little-Riv-Casino-Korea-Affect-Tourism"><a href="#Could-The-Distance-Between-Trump’s-Properties-and-Little-Riv-Casino-Korea-Affect-Tourism" class="headerlink" title="Could The Distance Between Trump’s Properties and Little Riv Casino Korea Affect Tourism?"></a>Could The Distance Between Trump’s Properties and Little Riv Casino Korea Affect Tourism?</h1><p>Since President Donald Trump was elected, there has been a lot of talk about how his businesses might conflict with his role as president. The big question on a lot of people’s minds is whether or not Trump having businesses all over the world could negatively impact tourism in those areas.<br>One of the most high-profile cases in this debate is Trump’s relationship with the Little Riv Casino Korea. The casino, which is being built by a Malaysian development company, is just a few miles away from two of Trump’s properties: the Trump World Tower and the $200 million Trump International Hotel and Tower. </p>
<p>The proximity of these properties has some people concerned that tourists might choose to stay at Trump’s hotels instead of the Little Riv Casino Korea. There are also concerns that if negotiations between the US and North Korea improve, tourists might choose to visit Pyongyang instead of Seoul because of Trump’s business interests there. </p>
<p>So far, it’s difficult to say exactly how much impact Trump’s businesses are having on tourism in these areas. However, it’s clear that this issue is something people are paying attention to and that it could have a significant impact on the future of tourism in these areas.</p>
