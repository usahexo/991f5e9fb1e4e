            <h1 id="New-Jersey-Sports-Betting-legality-Approved-by-U-S-Court"><a href="#New-Jersey-Sports-Betting-legality-Approved-by-U-S-Court" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Sports Betting legality Approved by U.S. Court"></a>New Jersey Sports Betting legality Approved by U.S. Court</h1><p>On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in favor of New Jersey regarding the state’s sports betting legality.</p>
<p>The decision overturns a previous ruling from 2016, which sided with the NCAA, NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL – the leagues that filed suit against New Jersey to prevent sports betting from being legalized.</p>
<p>What does this mean for New Jersey?</p>
<p>According to the court’s opinion, “the fact that plaintiffs engage in interstate commerce does not immunize them from [New Jersey’s] regulatory authority over gambling within its borders.”</p>
<p>This means that New Jersey can now move forward with legalizing sports betting within its borders, which is expected to provide a significant boost to the state’s economy.</p>
<p>Back in 2014, Delaware became the first state to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned such activities. At that time, New Jersey was one of several states that were considering similar measures. However, due to the legal challenge from the leagues mentioned above, those plans were put on hold.</p>
<p>What do the leagues say?</p>
<p>The leagues released a statement following Monday’s ruling:</p>
<p>We are disappointed by today’s ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and will consider our options moving forward. As we have said all along, we are hopeful that this issue will be resolved by Congress before it undermines the fundamental principle of amateurism on which collegiate athletics is based.</p>
<p>However, some experts believe that Monday’s ruling could actually work in favor of the leagues, as it opens up the possibility for Congress to take action and pass a federal law regulating sports betting. This would likely include regulations favoring the leagues, such as sharing in revenues from sports betting operations.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Sports-Betting-Begins-First-State-to-Offer-Legalized-Gambling"><a href="#Delaware-Sports-Betting-Begins-First-State-to-Offer-Legalized-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Sports Betting Begins: First State to Offer Legalized Gambling"></a>Delaware Sports Betting Begins: First State to Offer Legalized Gambling</h1><p>With the US Supreme Court overturning the federal ban on sports betting, individual states are now able to legalize gambling within their borders. Delaware is the first state to take advantage of this ruling, and residents can now place bets on NFL and college games at three casinos and online.</p>
<p>State officials estimate that sports betting will generate around $10 million in revenue during its first year, with a portion of that money going to the state lottery. This new form of gambling is likely to be popular in Delaware, where people have been illegally betting on sports for years.</p>
<p>Delaware had already been licensing sports books for off-track betting, so it was well prepared to offer legalized gambling. The state has also entered into partnerships with several major casino companies, which will operate the sports books at the casinos.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it will bring much needed revenue to states and create jobs. They also say that it will help deter illegal gambling and corruption in sport. Critics argue that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial hardship for some people.</p>
<p>How Will Delaware Sports Betting Impact You?</p>
<p>If you live in Delaware, you can now legally bet on NFL and college games at three casinos and online. State officials estimate that sports betting will generate around $10 million in revenue during its first year, with a portion of that money going to the state lottery.</p>
<p>Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial hardship for some people.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-D-C-Moves-to-Allow-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Washington-D-C-Moves-to-Allow-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Washington, D.C. Moves to Allow Sports Betting"></a>Washington, D.C. Moves to Allow Sports Betting</h1><p>Washington, D.C. is one of the latest jurisdictions to legalize sports betting in the wake of the landmark Supreme Court decision in May that overturned a law banning the practice. The D.C. Council passed legislation on Tuesday that would allow for both online and in-person sports betting, making the nation’s capital one of eight states to have such laws in place. </p>
<p>The bill now awaits a signature from Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has previously voiced her support for legalizing sports betting. Under the proposed law, the District would tax gross revenue from sports betting at a rate of 10 percent, which is higher than the rates levied in most other states that have legalized the activity. </p>
<p>States have been eager to legalize sports betting since the SCOTUS decision in May, as it could provide a new stream of revenue for state governments. The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which was overturned by the Court, had prohibited states from authorizing or licensing any form of sports gambling. </p>
<p>While many states have moved quickly to legalize sports betting, others are still weighing their options. In New Jersey, which led the charge against PASPA and saw its law upheld by the Supreme Court, regulators are still working on final rules for how casinos and racetracks will offer sports betting. </p>
<p>Industry experts expect that legal sports betting will be a multi-billion dollar business, with Americans wagering somewhere between $10 and $60 billion per year on sporting events.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Bettors-Win-as-SCOTUS-Rules-Federal-Law-Against-Sports-Gambling-Unconstitutional"><a href="#Sports-Bettors-Win-as-SCOTUS-Rules-Federal-Law-Against-Sports-Gambling-Unconstitutional" class="headerlink" title="Sports Bettors Win as SCOTUS Rules Federal Law Against Sports Gambling Unconstitutional"></a>Sports Bettors Win as SCOTUS Rules Federal Law Against Sports Gambling Unconstitutional</h1><p>In a ruling that could have far-reaching implications for sports betting across the United States, the Supreme Court on Monday struck down a federal law that barred most states from authorizing sports gambling.</p>
<p>The 6-3 ruling was a major victory for New Jersey and other states that want to allow sports betting, and it could open the door to broader legalization of gambling.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who wrote the majority opinion, said the federal law violated states’ rights under the 10th Amendment. The decision overturned a 1992 law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which had prohibited most states from allowing sports betting.</p>
<p>“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Justice Alito wrote. “Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”</p>
<p>The 10th Amendment says that powers not specifically granted to the federal government are reserved for the states or the people.</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen G. Breyer. She said she would have upheld the federal law because it did not violate states’ rights.</p>
<h1 id="California-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-wake-of-Supreme-Court-Ruling"><a href="#California-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-wake-of-Supreme-Court-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="California Poised to Legalize Sports Betting in wake of Supreme Court Ruling"></a>California Poised to Legalize Sports Betting in wake of Supreme Court Ruling</h1><p>On Monday, the United States Supreme Court overturned a federal law that had effectively banned sports betting across most of the country. The decision opens the door for states to legalize and regulate the activity, and it didn’t take long for officials in California to say they would move forward with proposals to do just that.</p>
<p>“Today’s ruling by the Supreme Court is a victory for the people of California and will allow us to move forward with a safe and responsible solution for legalized sports betting in our state,” said California Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) in a statement. “I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Legislature to get this done as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Proposals to legalize sports betting have been circulating in California since last year, when New Jersey prevailed in its challenge of the federal ban. But lawmakers had been waiting on the Supreme Court ruling before taking any formal action.</p>
<p>Now that the ban has been overturned, it’s expected that lawmakers in California will move quickly to pass a bill legalizing and regulating sports betting. Such a bill could be ready for Governor Jerry Brown’s signature as early as this summer.</p>
<p>Under such a bill, Californians would be able to place bets on professional and college sporting events at licensed casinos and race tracks around the state. The state would levy taxes on gambling revenues, with the money going towards programs designed to combat problem gambling.</p>
<p>Some opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates, but supporters say such concerns are overblown. They point out that many other forms of gambling are already legal in California, and that regulating sports betting will help ensure that bets are placed responsibly.</p>
<p>Besides, they argue, legalization will bring much-needed revenue to the state budget, which is currently struggling with large deficits. Estimates vary on how much money could be raised by legalizing sports betting in California, but some analysts put the figure at several hundred million dollars per year.</p>
<p>That money could be used to pay for important public services like education and healthcare, or it could be put towards reducing California’s massive debt load. Either way, it looks like legalized sports betting is headed for California – and that’s good news for gamblers everywhere.</p>
