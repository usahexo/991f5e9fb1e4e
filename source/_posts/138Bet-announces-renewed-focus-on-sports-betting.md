#  138Bet unveils new sports betting products

138Bet, one of Southeast Asia’s leading online sports betting platforms, has just announced the launch of two new sports betting products.

The first product is a live casino product that offers players the chance to bet on live sporting events. The second product is a virtual sports product that allows players to bet on simulated sporting events.

Both products are available now on 138Bet’s website and mobile app.

138Bet CEO Steven Saunders said: “We are very excited to launch these two new products. Our live casino product offers our players an immersive experience that they cannot get from ordinary sports betting, while our virtual sports product provides an exciting alternative to traditional sports betting.”

He added: “We believe that these products will be very popular with our players and we are committed to providing them with the best possible gaming experience.”

#  138Bet strengthens its sports offering

138Bet, one of the world’s leading online sports betting companies, is continuing its growth trajectory with a number of recent product enhancements.

The company has significantly strengthened its sports offering in order to provide an even more engaging experience for customers. This includes the addition of several new leagues and competitions, as well as a host of innovative features and betting markets.

In addition to 138Bet’s market-leading football offering, which includes leagues and competitions from all over the world, the company has now added US basketball, cricket and ice hockey to its line-up. This gives avid sports fans a greater range of betting options on the sports they love.

Fans of NBA basketball can now bet on games from both the Eastern and Western Conferences, while those who prefer cricket can enjoy in-play betting on matches from around the globe. Ice hockey enthusiasts can now bet on games from both the NHL and Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

To complement these new sports offerings, 138Bet has enhanced its live streaming service. This means customers can watch live games as they happen, placing bets directly from within the streaming window. In addition to being able to watch sporting events in real time, customers can also access detailed match data and statistics, as well as in-play betting options.

138Bet Managing Director James Dean said: “We are always looking for new ways to improve our customer experience and strengthen our product offering. Our latest enhancements reflect our commitment to providing our customers with the best possible experience when betting on their favourite sports.”

#  138Bet commits to becoming a top sports betting operator

138Bet has announced its plans to become a top sports betting operator. The company is looking to improve its product range, customer experience, and marketing initiatives in order to attract new customers and grow its market share.

138Bet has already seen success in the online sports betting market, but the company is looking to take things to the next level. Improvements will be made across all aspects of the business, with a focus on making 138Bet the go-to choice for sports bettors.

This commitment to becoming a top sports betting operator will see 138Bet expand its product offering, with a greater focus on live betting and in-play markets. Customer experience will also be improved, with a new website design and more responsive customer support. Marketing initiatives will be stepped up to ensure that 138Bet is top of mind when it comes to choosing a sports betting operator.

138Bet’s CEO David Wang had this to say about the company’s plans: “We are extremely excited about our plans to become a top sports betting operator. We have seen great success so far, but we know that there is more we can do to make 138Bet the go-to choice for players around the world. We are committed to improving every aspect of our business and we believe that this will lead to continued growth and success in the years ahead.”

138Bet is well on its way to becoming a top sports betting operator and players can expect even better services in the future. With improvements being made across all aspects of the business, 138Bet is sure to continue attracting new customers and growing its market share.

#  138Bet ramps up its investment in sports betting

138Bet ramps up its investment in sports betting, with a view to capitalising on the predicted growth in the industry.

The global sports betting market is forecast to grow by 9.5% over the next five years, reaching a value of $81.7 billion by 2023, according to a new report from MarketsandMarkets[1]. This represents an increase of almost $10 billion on the current size of the market.

138Bet is well placed to take advantage of this growth, having made significant investments in its technology and product offering over the past year. The company has introduced a new website and mobile app, as well as a host of new features and products. These include an expanded range of markets, live streaming of sporting events and a VIP loyalty programme.

138Bet’s Managing Director, John attributed the company’s success to its focus on innovation: “We are always looking for ways to improve our product and service offering for our customers. This has been key to our success over the past year, with growth across all markets. We are now well placed to capitalise on the growth in the sports betting market.”

 138Bet is not alone in recognising the potential of the sports betting market. Online gambling giant Bet365 recently announced plans to invest £500 million in expanding its operations, while rival William Hill has also made significant investments in recent years.

However, John believes that 138Bet offers something different: “We offer a more personalised experience for our customers, with a focus on customer service and innovation. This is why we have been successful in attracting new customers and building loyalty among our existing customer base.”

The industry is set for continued growth over the next few years and 138Bet looks well placed to take advantage of this trend. With its focus on innovation and customer service, 138Bet is well placed to become one of the leading players in the global sports betting market.
