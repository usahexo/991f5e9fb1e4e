#  It's now legal to bet on sports in Arizona!

In a landmark decision by the Arizona Supreme Court, it is now legal for residents of Arizona to bet on sports. This is great news for fans of sports betting, as they can now place bets on their favorite teams without having to worry about breaking the law.

The court's decision comes after several years of debate on the issue. Supporters of sports betting argue that it is a harmless way to enjoy sporting events, while opponents claim that it can lead to addiction and crime. In the end, however, the court sided with the supporters, ruling that sports betting is not a threat to public safety and can be enjoyed in a responsible manner.

This ruling is likely to have a major impact on the gambling industry in Arizona. The state is home to several large casinos, and it is likely that many of them will begin offering sports betting once the decision goes into effect. This should provide a major boost to the state's economy, as well as create new jobs in the gambling industry.

Sports fans in Arizona are sure to rejoice at this news. They can now place bets on their favorite teams without fear of being arrested or facing other legal penalties. This will add an extra layer of excitement to sporting events, making them even more enjoyable to watch.

#  Sports betting begins today in Arizona!

The Diamondbacks and Rockies open up their series today in Phoenix, with the first pitch scheduled for 12:40 p.m. MST. 
Both teams are coming off of losses on Friday night, so there is certainly an incentive to win this early game on Saturday. 
Colorado is currently a -123 favorite to win the game, while Arizona is at +113. 
This line seems about right, as the Rockies have been playing better baseball as of late while the Diamondbacks continue to struggle.

There are a few key matchups that could have an impact on the game. For Colorado, left fielder Gerardo Parra will likely be matched up against Diamondbacks pitcher Patrick Corbin. Parra has been red-hot as of late and is batting .405 this season. If Corbin can’t get Parra out, it could be a long day for the D-Backs. 
Colorado’s bullpen will also need to be strong in this matchup, as Arizona has some dangerous hitters coming up late in the order.

For Arizona, Paul Goldschmidt will be a player to watch. He has been one of the few bright spots for the team this year and is batting .317 with 16 home runs already. If he can continue his hot streak, it could help Arizona pull off an upset victory. 
Overall, I expect Colorado to win this game but it should be close. Take the Rockies -123 over the Diamondbacks +113 for your Saturday afternoon betting action!
