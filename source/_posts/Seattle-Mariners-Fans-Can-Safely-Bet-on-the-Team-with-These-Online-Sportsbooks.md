The Mariners rank near the bottom of the league in offensive output this season, but they may be able to turn it around in the second half.

Seattle fans can relax - your money is safe when betting on the Mariners online. The team ranks near the bottom of the league in offensive output this season, but they may be able to turn it around in the second half.

While Seattle’s offense has been disappointing so far, there are still some good players on the team. Robinson Cano is a perennial all-star, and Nelson Cruz provides power in the lineup. Jean Segura and Mitch Haniger have also been solid contributors so far this year.

If Seattle’s hitters can start to hit like they are capable of, the team could make a run at the playoffs. The Mariners currently sit four games out of a playoff spot, so there is definitely room for them to improve.

If you want to bet on the Mariners online, there are plenty of great options available. My favorite site for betting on baseball is BetOnline.ag. They offer great odds on all MLB games, as well as a wide variety of other sports betting options.
