#  Casino War: San Diego Has More Slot Machines

Slot machines are a popular pastime in San Diego, and the city has more slot machines than any other place in the state of California. The concentration of slot machines is not just in downtown San Diego, but also in suburban areas like Mission Valley and Eastlake.

One factor that may contribute to the high concentration of slots in San Diego is the city’s wide variety of casinos. There are 11 casinos in San Diego, which is more than any other city in California. Casinos can be found in all regions of the city, from downtown to the suburbs.

Another reason for the high concentration of slots may be that San Diego is a popular tourist destination.

It’s possible that some of these tourists decide to try their luck at the casino slot machines while they’re in town.

#  Reno Regency Sands Casino Has Fewer Slot Machines Than San Diego Casinos

A Reno Gazette Journal analysis of statewide data found the Regency Sands Casino in Reno has far fewer slot machines than casinos in San Diego.

The Reno casino has 927 slots, while San Diego casinos have an average of 3,502 slots, the data show.

“There’s just not as much interest in slot machines here as there is in San Diego,” said Charles Vaughn, president of the Regency Sands.

The discrepancy could be due to several factors, including the higher populations and tourist traffic in San Diego County. It also could be attributed to the casinos’ varied designs and amenities, which might make them more appealing to gamblers.

Reno has a population of about 250,000, while San Diego County has about 4 million people.
