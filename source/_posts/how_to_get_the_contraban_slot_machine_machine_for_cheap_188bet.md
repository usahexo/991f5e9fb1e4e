# How to Get the Contraband Slot Machine for Cheap

Are you looking for a way to acquire a contraband slot machine at a low cost? While owning a slot machine is legal in some states and countries, owning a contraband slot machine is not legal anywhere. However, if you're determined to get one, there are a few ways you could try to do so. Keep in mind that we do not condone or endorse any illegal activities related to obtaining or owning a contraband slot machine. 

Here are some possible methods:

## 1. Online Auctions

One option is to search online auction sites like eBay, Craigslist, or Facebook Marketplace. While it's unlikely that someone will openly sell a contraband slot machine, you may be able to find someone who is selling an old slot machine and is not aware that it is contraband. Keep in mind that even if you purchase a slot machine legally, you cannot use it to gamble for money unless you have the proper licenses.

## 2. Estate Sales or Garage Sales

Another option is to look for slot machines at estate sales or garage sales. Sometimes, people who inherit a slot machine may not be aware that it is contraband or may not care about the legalities of owning one. If you do find a slot machine at a garage sale or estate sale, be sure to check your local laws regarding ownership and use.

## 3. Through an Illegal Network

While we strongly advise against it, you could also try to obtain a contraband slot machine through illegal channels. However, this method is not only illegal but also very risky. Not only could you face legal consequences, but you may also be putting yourself in danger by dealing with criminals.

## 4. Build Your Own

If you have the technical skills and resources, you could try to build your own slot machine. However, this would require a lot of research and knowledge, and it's important to note that it is illegal to build a slot machine for gambling purposes without proper licensing.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, owning a contraband slot machine is illegal and not recommended. However, if you're determined to get one, there are a few ways you could try to do so, such as through online auctions, estate or garage sales, illegal networks, or building your own. But it's important to remember that owning a slot machine, whether legal or not, does not guarantee you any winnings, and gambling should always be done responsibly and within the limits of the law.
